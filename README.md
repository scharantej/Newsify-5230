### HTML Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the latest news articles. It includes the necessary HTML layout and elements to display the articles.

### Routes

- `/fetch_news_articles`: A background route that fetches the latest news articles from an external API or source and persists them in the database. This route is typically called using JavaScript or Ajax from the `index.html` page.
- `/update_news_articles`: An API route that updates the news articles in the database. It can be used to add, delete, or modify news articles.
- `/get_news_articles`: An API route that retrieves the news articles from the database. It can be used to fetch all articles or filter them based on criteria such as category or date.
